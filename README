Reproducing the environment for a maven-eclipse-plugin bug

A parent pom you don't control (corporate mandated pom) defines the addVersionToProjectName in the pluginManagement section. 
You don't want that behaviour and try to override it in your own pom
The project name is correctly generated, but the .classpath file keeps the version added, breaking the workspace.

Looking more closely it seems this bug was hit before :
